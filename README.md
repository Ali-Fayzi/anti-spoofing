# Anti Spoofing
Anti-spoofing with deep learning is a technique that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to prevent unauthorized access by malicious actors who impersonate legitimate users, particularly in image-based data such as facial recognition. These networks are trained to recognize specific features of biometric data that indicate authenticity.
In this project, MiniFASNetV2 and MiniFASNetV1SE networks, which have been previously trained, have been used.
